Broken Wings
============

Broken Wings is a creative flight blocker. It works per-dimension.

The default settings block flight in the Twilight Forest. It can be configured as a whitelist of a blacklist for dimensions to allow flight in, or to blanket-ban all creative flight in all dimensions. You can also choose to block elytra flight.
